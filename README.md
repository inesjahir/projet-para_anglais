**SimpleKanban** is a responsive and interactive **task management board** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The project simulates a classic Kanban workflow with **drag-and-drop** functionality to move tasks between columns.

This project was initially inspired by the tutorial:  
👉 [HTML, CSS & JavaScript Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAiX0itnonM),  
which I then customized with my own layout, logic, visuals, and structure.

> ⚠️ This is a **front-end only** application — all questions and logic run directly in the browser, with no database or backend.
